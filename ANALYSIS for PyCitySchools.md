# Analysis of PyCitySchools

### It is hard not to arrive at decisive conclusions from this homework assignment.

* For some background information, I imported the scrapbook module so I could get a file collecting outputs of the dataframes for the results of each analysis.  I used my main.ipynb Jupyter notebook file and made a copy where I could run the codeblocks for the scrapbook module.  I called this copy main-to-make-scraps-from.ipynb, and the resulting file where I reglued all the scraps back together is main-outputs-only.ipynb.  It made it easier to come to conclusions with the data collated like this.

### The first conclusion I came to is Charter schools have a much better success rate than District schools.

* The percentages of students passing Math, Reading, and both combined are obvious from the Top Performing School by % Overall passing table.  The top five are all Charter schools.  As you go through the additional tables for Math Scores by Grade and Reading Scores by Grade, the scores by grade for the Charter schools is consistently higher by 5 - 6 percentage points for each year!  The final table with the direct overall comparison of success rates between Charter and District schools is a most definitive statement towards this conclusion. 

### The second conclusion which sticks out of the collective analysis are the factors that contribute to the success of Charter schools.  The success rates associated with smaller school size combined with the success rates with lower average spending per student help support the premise behind the foundation of Charter schools.

* A review of the Bottom Performing Schools shows the highest range of total students for each of these schools.  Indeed, the table for Scores by School Size show that schools with the least amount of students have higher success rates.
* In looking at the Top Performing Schools, it would seem evident the Charter schools are all smaller; but, they show in the Medium range as far as Total Students.  However, a review of the School Summary table shows that all of the smallest schools are also Charter.  So, the trend is for smaller school size shown with Charter schools being in the lower half of the range for the Medium size schools combined with them solely occupying the Small range once again supports the conclusion that the smaller size of Charter schools contributes to their higher success rate.
* While the Scores by School Type table is once more definitive in showing Charter schools have a higher success rate, the data for Average Spending Per Student does not show an intuitive reasoning where higher spending per student would have a higher success rate.  One description of Charter schools suggests their overall budget is more focused, and the average spending rate per student would thereby be less.  The higher success rate for Charter schools with less money spent would indicate one of the goals set forth by state governments is being met.
* Charter schools are smaller and they have more focused, yet smaller, budgets; and, the success rates show for these two traits associated with Charter schools help confirm the guidance behind having Charter schools.
